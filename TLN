TODO:
- new entity creation: authoritative, especulative (needs to find a matching
  authoritative within X time).
  - registry for new entities
  -
  -
- full entity creation sync (for new playes)

- clock and ping sync


IDEAS:
- fixed time stamp for simulation (20hz?)
- time sync + ping average subsystem
- can be used with any pub/sub transport mechanism (Deepstream, WebRTC)
